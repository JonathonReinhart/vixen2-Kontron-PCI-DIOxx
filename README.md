========================

Vixen 2.x plugin for Kontron PCI-DIOxx boards

This code was written without actually owning one of these boards. I was working with TooMuchWork2 from the doityourselfchristmas.com forums to try and get a plugin implemented. While there were some successes with detecting boards, etc. I have no indication that the plugin ever made it to completion.  The code is here for anyone who wants to see it though.
