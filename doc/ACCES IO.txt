From ACCES I/O:
http://accesio.com/go.cgi?p=/cat/kontron.html

	Since 1987 ACCES I/O Products, Inc. has provided data acquisition and control products to the
	market as an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) through Kontron (actually ICS, then
	ICS Advent, and then Kontron).

	In February, 2010, many Kontron customers were surprised to receive an EOL (End of Life)
	notification regarding a large variety of ACCES I/O data acquisition and control products.
	Please note, these products are actually not EOL'd, Kontron has simply decided to eliminate
	these products from their overall product offering. ACCES has no plans to discontinue
	manufacturing any of its products listed in the EOL notification below. Many of the products we
	first designed back in 1987 are still shipping to this day. We have great experience and pride
	with our capability to design and manufacture products with extended life cycles.

	The ACCES part numbers listed below are 100% replacements for corresponding Kontron products.
	Kontron’s Last Time Buy on August 31, 2010 simply means that you will have to purchase these
	products from ACCES or through one of our distributors/resellers.

	
I think this is the board this code was written to work with:

While I can't find the original zip file of everything I used to get started on this plugin, there
appears to be a whole bunch of possibly related stuff here:
